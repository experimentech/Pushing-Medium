# Physics Demonstrations

Core physics simulations demonstrating the pushing-medium gravitational model across various scenarios.

## Progressive Introduction (demo1-demo7)

Start here for a step-by-step introduction to PMFlow concepts:

- **demo1.py**: Basic refractive index calculations
- **demo2.py**: Simple gravitational deflection  
- **demo3.py**: Point mass effects
- **demo4.py**: Multi-body interactions
- **demo5.py**: Dynamic scenarios
- **demo6.py**: Advanced applications
- **demo7.py**: Complex multi-physics systems

## Gravitational Dynamics

### **pushing_medium.py**
Core demonstration of the pushing-medium model showing how gravitational effects emerge from refractive index variations.

### **lagrange_1.py**, **lagrange_2.py** 
Lagrange point dynamics in the Earth-Moon system using PMFlow equations. Shows how gravitational balance points behave under the pushing-medium framework.

### **grav_lensing.py**
Gravitational lensing simulation using the refractive index model. Demonstrates light deflection around massive objects.

## Plasma & Medium Physics

### **plasma_flythrough_demo.py**
Simulation of objects moving through plasma with PMFlow medium effects.

### **plasma_flythrough_demo2.py**  
Extended plasma simulation with additional physics.

### **plasma_index_demo.py**
Static demonstration of refractive index effects in plasma environments.

### **plasma_index_animate.py**
Animated version showing time evolution of plasma index effects.

## Usage

Each demo is self-contained. Run individual scripts:

```bash
python demo1.py    # Start here for beginners
python pushing_medium.py    # Core PMFlow demonstration  
python grav_lensing.py     # Gravitational lensing
```

Most demos generate plots or animations showing the physical behavior under the pushing-medium model.
