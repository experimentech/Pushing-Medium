# Pushing–Medium Model: Formulae and Interpretations

This document summarizes the core formulas of the Pushing–Medium gravitational model and provides interpretations for each.

## 1. Static Refractive Index Field from Point Masses

$$
n(\mathbf{r}) = 1 + \sum_i \frac{\mu_i}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i|}
$$
where
$$
\mu_i = \frac{2GM_i}{c^2}
$$
**Interpretation:**
The refractive index at position $\mathbf{r}$ is increased by the presence of point masses $M_i$ at positions $\mathbf{r}_i$. The effect of each mass decreases with distance, and $\mu_i$ sets the strength of each contribution based on mass and physical constants.

## 2. Optional Flow Field (Frame–Drag Analogue)

$$
\mathbf{u}_g(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i \boldsymbol{\Omega}_i \times (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$
**Interpretation:**
This velocity field is analogous to frame dragging in General Relativity. Each source has an angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_i$, and the field at $\mathbf{r}$ is given by the cross product with the displacement from each source.

## 3. Time-Dependent Perturbation (Wave Injection)

$$
\delta n_{\mathrm{wave}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = A \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)
$$
**Interpretation:**
A wave-like disturbance in the refractive index, propagating through space with amplitude $A$, wave vector $\mathbf{k}$, and angular frequency $\omega$. This models dynamic gravitational effects similar to gravitational waves.

## 4. Total Refractive Index Field

$$
n_{\mathrm{total}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = n(\mathbf{r}) + \delta n_{\mathrm{wave}}(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$
**Interpretation:**
The total refractive index at any point and time is the sum of the static field from masses and the dynamic wave perturbation.

---

**Summary:**
This model describes gravity as changes in a refractive index field, influenced by mass distributions and dynamic wave phenomena. The flow field introduces effects similar to frame dragging, and the wave term allows for time-dependent gravitational effects. This approach is an alternative to the curvature-based description in General Relativity, using medium-like properties and classical field analogies.
