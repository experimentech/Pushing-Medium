Here’s the **side‑by‑side** you asked for — showing the key GR equations alongside their **pushing‑medium model** counterparts, so a reviewer can instantly see what’s been swapped, what replaces it, and how the weak‑field limit lines up.  

---

| **Concept** | **GR Formulation** | **Pushing‑Medium Formulation** | **Weak‑Field Match** |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Field equation** | \(G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}\) — curvature sourced by stress–energy | Substrate state equation: gradients in substrate density \(\rho_s\) and pressure \(P_s\) drive accelerations; geometry is derived, not fundamental | Calibrated so that static, weak‑field limit reproduces Newtonian \(g(r) \propto 1/r^2\) |
| **Equation of motion** | Geodesic equation: \(\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau} \frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau} = 0\) | Force law: \(\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho_s} \nabla P_s\) — motion from substrate pressure gradients | Matches Newton’s 2nd law with gravitational acceleration in weak field |
| **Potential equation** | Poisson: \(\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho\) | \(\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\rho_s} \nabla P_s \right) = S(\text{mass})\), where \(S\) encodes how matter displaces/compresses substrate | Reduces to Poisson form when \(\rho_s\) is uniform and \(P_s \propto \Phi\) |
| **Time dilation** | \(\frac{\Delta t_{\text{far}}}{\Delta t_{\text{near}}} \approx 1 + \frac{\Phi}{c^2}\) (weak field) | \(\frac{\Delta t_{\text{far}}}{\Delta t_{\text{near}}} = f\!\left( \frac{\rho_s(\text{near})}{\rho_s(\text{far})} \right)\), with \(f\) chosen to match GR slope in weak field | Matches gravitational redshift to first order |
| **Light propagation** | Null geodesics: \(ds^2 = 0\) in curved spacetime | Fermat’s principle in medium with index \(n(\mathbf{x})\) set by \(\rho_s\); bending and delay from optical‑path effects | Recovers GR’s light deflection and Shapiro delay in weak field |
| **Cosmic expansion** | Friedmann: \(\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}\) | \(\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho_m + E(a) - \frac{k}{a^2}\), with \(E(a)\) from substrate elasticity/back‑reaction | Can be tuned to match ΛCDM’s \(a(t)\) over observed range |
| **Stress–energy content** | \(T_{\mu\nu}\) = matter/energy + pressure in spacetime | \(T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{matter}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{substrate}}\), with substrate term allowing anisotropy, hysteresis, thresholds | Reduces to matter‑only \(T_{\mu\nu}\) when substrate is uniform and isotropic |

**Key takeaways from the table:**
- In GR, curvature is the *cause*; in the pushing‑medium model, it’s a *description* of the substrate’s state.
- Geodesics are replaced by a direct force law from pressure/density gradients.
- Time and light effects come from local medium properties, not from metric curvature per se.
- Cosmological acceleration comes from medium elasticity, not a constant Λ.
- Weak‑field calibration ensures the two models are observationally indistinguishable in Solar System tests — differences emerge in strong‑field, dynamical, or anisotropic regimes.

If you want, I can now extend this into a **timeline** that starts with the original GR‑comparison smoke tests, then shows where each of these substitutions was exercised and validated in our later gating, hysteresis, anisotropy, and cosmology runs. That would give you a clean “story arc” for the model’s development.
