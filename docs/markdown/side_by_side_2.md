## Gr vs pushing‑medium equations

| Concept | GR formulation | Pushing‑medium formulation | Weak‑field alignment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Field equation | \(G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}\) | Substrate state law: accelerations arise from substrate density/pressure fields; geometry is derived | Calibrate to reproduce Newtonian limit |
| Equation of motion | Geodesic: \(\frac{d^2 x^\mu}{d\tau^2} + \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta}\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\tau}\frac{dx^\beta}{d\tau}=0\) | Force law: \(\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho_s}\nabla P_s\) | Matches \(g=-\nabla \Phi\) in static weak field |
| Potential/constraint | Poisson: \(\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho\) | \(\nabla \cdot \!\left(\frac{1}{\rho_s}\nabla P_s\right)= S(\text{mass})\) (matter displaces/compresses substrate) | Reduces to Poisson when \(\rho_s\) uniform and \(P_s \propto \Phi\) |
| Time dilation | \(d\tau \approx dt\,(1+\Phi/c^2)\) (weak field) | Clock rate set by local substrate state: \(d\tau = dt\,f\!\big(\rho_s,P_s\big)\) | First‑order slope matches GR after calibration |
| Light propagation | Null geodesics: \(ds^2=0\) | Fermat in medium with index \(n(\mathbf{x})\) tied to \(\rho_s\) | Recovers deflection and Shapiro delay |
| Cosmic expansion | \(\left(\dot a/a\right)^2=\tfrac{8\pi G}{3}\rho -\tfrac{k}{a^2}+\tfrac{\Lambda}{3}\) | \(\left(\dot a/a\right)^2=\tfrac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_m + E(a) - \tfrac{k}{a^2}\) (substrate elasticity/back‑reaction) | Tunable to match ΛCDM over data range |
| Stress–energy content | Single \(T_{\mu\nu}\) for matter/fields | \(T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{matter}} + T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{substrate}}\) (allows anisotropy, memory, thresholds) | Reduces to matter‑only when substrate uniform |
| Equivalence/conservation | Local Lorentz invariance; covariant conservation \(\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}=0\) | Enforce medium‑frame conservation; effective Lorentz symmetry in linear limit | Matches UFF and virial tests in weak field |
