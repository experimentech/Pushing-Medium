# The Pushing-Medium Model: Technical Overview

## Abstract

The Pushing-Medium model presents an alternative theory of gravitation that replaces Einstein's curved spacetime with a flat Euclidean background containing a medium with variable refractive index and flow fields. This model uses optical analogies to reproduce gravitational phenomena, offering computational advantages and intuitive understanding while maintaining compatibility with observed gravitational effects in weak-field regimes.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Core Concept

The Pushing-Medium model is based on the premise that gravitational effects arise not from spacetime curvature, but from variations in a physical medium's properties:

- **Background**: Flat, fixed Euclidean space-time
- **Medium Properties**: Spatially and temporally varying refractive index $n(\mathbf{r}, t)$
- **Additional Effects**: Optional flow field $\mathbf{u}_g(\mathbf{r}, t)$ for frame-dragging analogues
- **Wave Phenomena**: Explicit wave perturbations for gravitational wave analogues

### 1.2 Philosophical Differences from General Relativity

| Aspect | General Relativity | Pushing-Medium Model |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Nature of Space-time** | Dynamic, curved manifold | Static, flat Euclidean background |
| **Gravitational Field** | Encoded in metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ | Encoded in refractive index $n$ and flow $\mathbf{u}_g$ |
| **Field Equations** | Einstein field equations (covariant) | Phenomenological formulas for $n$ and $\mathbf{u}_g$ |
| **Matter Motion** | Timelike geodesics | Modified Newtonian dynamics |
| **Light Propagation** | Null geodesics | Fermat's principle in moving medium |

## 2. Mathematical Formulation

### 2.1 Static Refractive Index Field

**Point Mass Configuration:**
$$
n(\mathbf{r}) = 1 + \sum_i \frac{\mu_i}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i|}, \quad \mu_i = \frac{2GM_i}{c^2}
$$

**Continuous Mass Distribution:**
$$
n(\mathbf{r}) = 1 + \frac{2G}{c^2} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'|} \, d^3 r'
$$

**Interpretation:** Masses raise the local refractive index; higher index corresponds to effective time dilation / slower coordinate light speed.

### 2.2 Gradient of Refractive Index

$$
\nabla n(\mathbf{r}) = -\sum_i \frac{2GM_i}{c^2 |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i|^3} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$

**Interpretation:** The gradient direction specifies attractive response; magnitude sets bending or acceleration strength.

### 2.3 Flow Field (Frame-Dragging Analogue)

**Rotational Flow:**
$$
\mathbf{u}_g(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i \boldsymbol{\Omega}_i \times (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)
$$

**Angular Velocity from Spin:**
$$
\omega_s(r) = \frac{2GJ}{c^2 r^3}
$$

**Interpretation:** Mimics Lense–Thirring‑like frame influence by advecting rays and massive trajectories.

### 2.4 Gravitational Wave Analogues

**Time-Dependent Perturbation:**
$$
\delta n_{\mathrm{wave}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = A \cos(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t + \phi_0)
$$

**TT Wave Equation:**
$$
\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x^2} = 0
$$

**Interpretation:** TT‑style perturbations propagate at speed $c$; phenomenological, not derived from covariant field equations.

### 2.5 Total Field Configuration

$$
n_{\mathrm{total}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = n(\mathbf{r}) + \delta n_{\mathrm{wave}}(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

---

## 3. Dynamics and Motion

### 3.1 Light Ray Propagation

**Ray Equation (Fermat's Principle):**
$$
\frac{d\hat{\mathbf{k}}}{ds} = \nabla_{\!\perp} \ln n_{\mathrm{total}}(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

**Ray Velocity with Flow Advection:**
$$
\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \frac{c\,\hat{\mathbf{k}}}{n_{\mathrm{total}}} + \mathbf{u}_g(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

**Fermat Functional:**
$$
T = \int n\,ds - \frac{1}{c} \int (n^2 - 1)(\mathbf{u}_g \cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}})\,ds
$$

**Interpretation:** Rays extremize optical travel time producing lensing and time‑delay analogues.

### 3.1.1 Current implementation status
- Static index: `fermat_deflection_static_index` integrates $\partial_x \ln n$ along a straight reference path and numerically reproduces $4GM/(c^2 b)$.
- Moving lens: present code exposes a heuristic $k_{\mathrm{Fizeau}}$ (near unity) and a straight‑path translational correction; higher fidelity path‑corrected advection is planned.

### 3.2 Massive Particle Motion

**Optical-Mechanical Acceleration:**
$$
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{med}}(\mathbf{r}, t) = -c^2 \nabla \ln n_{\mathrm{total}}(\mathbf{r}, t)
$$

**Newtonian Gravity Component:**
$$
\mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{grav}}(\mathbf{r}) = -\sum_i \frac{GM_i (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i|^3}
$$

**Combined Equation of Motion:**
$$
\frac{d^2 \mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{grav}} + \mathbf{a}_{\mathrm{med}} + \text{(flow coupling)}
$$

**Interpretation:** Motion combines Newtonian inverse‑square attraction with an additional gradient‑index term.

## 10. Unexplored Predictions & Experimental Tests

Outlined below are candidate phenomena for future discrimination; each includes rationale, indicative signature, and a schematic test.

1) Medium microphysics and constitutive relations
- Why it matters: unlike GR, the pushing‑medium requires a substrate model (compressible fluid, elastic field, condensate) and a constitutive relation linking substrate state to $n(\rho_s,P_s)$. Different microphysics predict measurable differences.
- Signature: frequency‑dependent wave propagation, dissipative losses, or mode conversion during strong events.
- Test: compare waveforms from merger simulations across different constitutive models; look for systematic deviations from GR templates.

2) Dispersion, attenuation and birefringence of gravitational signals
- Why it matters: the medium can be dispersive or anisotropic, producing frequency and polarization dependent propagation that vacuum GR forbids.
- Signature: frequency‑dependent arrival times, amplitude roll‑off, or polarization mixing in GW detectors.
- Test: search LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalogues for residual dispersion beyond current constraints; run injection/recovery studies with simple dispersive models.

3) Preferred frame and small Lorentz violations
- Why it matters: a physical substrate defines a rest frame, so tiny frame‑dependent effects (anisotropic propagation, seasonal modulation) are allowed.
- Signature: minute anisotropy in light speed or GW speed relative to the CMB/rest frame; sidereal modulation of precision clocks/tests.
- Test: re‑analyse high‑precision Lorentz invariance experiments and multi‑messenger timing (EM vs GW) for correlated residuals.

4) Local energy/momentum bookkeeping and back‑reaction
- Why it matters: the medium provides a local substrate energy density and momentum flux, enabling alternate accounts of gravitational wave energy loss and back‑reaction.
- Signature: different ringdown damping rates or energy partitioning during mergers.
- Test: compute substrate energy budget in toy merger models and compare predicted damping/ringdown with observed waveforms.

5) Horizon microstructure, echoes, and near‑horizon phenomenology
- Why it matters: horizons in a medium picture could correspond to refractive trapping, phase changes, or shock fronts, not geometric singularities.
- Signature: echoes, small deviations of black‑hole shadows, or modified near‑horizon EM/GW scattering.
- Test: ray‑tracing around a substrate model that stiffens near a compact core to simulate echoes/shadow changes.

6) Possible equivalence‑principle violations
- Why it matters: substrate coupling could depend weakly on composition or internal structure, violating strong or weak EP at some level.
- Signature: composition‑dependent free‑fall, anomalous tidal responses.
- Test: precision torsion‑balance, lunar laser ranging, and pulsar timing differential tests targeted at predicted coupling forms.

7) Nonlinear substrate dynamics and emergent effects (shocks, turbulence)
- Why it matters: hydrodynamic or elastic substrate equations can create shocks, turbulence, or instabilities that have no direct analogue in GR PDEs.
- Signature: transient, broadband emissions or stochastic backgrounds from substrate turbulence during violent events.
- Test: evolve simple nonlinear substrate PDEs for merger analogues and quantify stochastic emission spectra.

8) Cosmological re‑interpretation: vacuum energy and expansion
- Why it matters: substrate pressure/density naturally supplies new degrees of freedom for cosmic acceleration, potentially replacing or altering Λ interpretations.
- Signature: subtle changes in distance–redshift relations or growth of structure.
- Test: fit simple substrate cosmologies to SN/BAO/CMB compressed constraints and evaluate parameter degeneracies with dark energy.

9) Light‑propagation subtleties (Fermat vs null geodesic corrections)
- Why it matters: advection by $\mathbf{u}_g$, anisotropic indices, or higher‑order index corrections can produce departures from GR null geodesics.
- Signature: polarization‑dependent lensing, small extra time delays, microlensing residuals.
- Test: high‑precision lensing/time‑delay systems and polarimetric monitoring.

10) Quantum field coupling and semiclassical effects

## 11. Skeletons & flow‑map modelling

This subsection explains how to extract the qualitative transport skeleton of substrate fields used in the pushing‑medium model. "Skeletons" here means the set of stationary points (equilibria), their linearized classification, and the invariant manifolds (stable/unstable separatrices) and ridge/valley lines that organise transport and lensing.

### 11.1 Conceptual summary

- For scalar landscapes (for example, an effective potential Φ(x,y) or an index field `n_eff`), skeletons include minima, maxima, saddles, and the ridge/valley lines (crests and troughs) that separate basins.
- For vector flows (substrate velocity `u` or rotating‑frame `uOmega`), skeletons are built from stagnation points where `uOmega(r)=0`; the Jacobian at a stagnation point gives eigenvectors whose unstable/stable manifolds trace separatrices in the flow.

### 11.2 Where to find the code

The repository already contains two complementary implementations:

- `Physics/vector_skeleton.py` — root‑finding, Jacobian, classification, and manifold tracing for 2D rotating‑frame substrate flows. Key API elements:
  - `Body(pos, gamma)` — positional sources and strengths
  - `VectorFlow(bodies, omega, eps2=...)` — flow factory
  - `VectorFlow.u(r)` — base substrate inflow
  - `VectorFlow.uOmega(r)` — flow including rotating‑frame term
  - `VectorFlow.J(r)` — analytic Jacobian of `uOmega`
  - `VectorFlow.newton_root(r0, tol, itmax)` — Newton solver for stagnations
  - `VectorFlow.classify(rstar)` — eigenvalue/eigenvector analysis and label
  - `VectorFlow.trace_manifold(stag, kind, ds, max_steps, rmax)` — trace stable/unstable manifolds
  - `seeds_two_body(...)`, `continue_stagnations(...)` — helpers for seeding and parameter sweeps

- `Physics/demos/skeleton_finder.py` — grid‑based scalar skeleton extraction (ridges/valleys and stationary point detection) using finite differences and image‑processing style thinning. Use this when working from `n_eff(x,y)` or any scalar Φ defined on a grid.

### 11.3 Practical workflow

1. Choose representation
    - If you have an analytic or particle-sourced flow, use `VectorFlow` and the stagnation/manifold machinery.
    - If you have a gridded scalar field (e.g., `n_eff` on a fixed 2D grid), run `skeleton_finder.py` to extract ridges/valleys and stationary points.

2. Seed and locate stagnations
    - Use physics‑informed seeds such as `seeds_two_body(...)` for two‑body-like setups, or derive seeds from a coarse grid scan (look for sign changes in `uOmega` components or small |uOmega| regions).
    - Run `VectorFlow.newton_root(seed)` to converge to stagnation points. If the Jacobian is singular or Newton fails, try slightly different seeds or increase softening `eps2`.

3. Classify and inspect linearization
    - Use `VectorFlow.classify(r)` to obtain eigenvalues/eigenvectors and an initial label (saddle/node/center). Plot eigenvectors at the stagnation location to confirm orientation.

4. Trace manifolds
    - For saddles, call `trace_manifold(stag, 'unstable')` and `'stable'` to integrate outward along eigenvector directions. Overlay the traced polylines on streamplots or scalar contours to verify they align with separatrices.

5. Parameter sweeps
    - Use `continue_stagnations(flow_factory, phases, r0_list)` to follow stagnations as bodies move (e.g., sweep the moon phase) and observe bifurcations or annihilations of equilibria.

### 11.4 Numerical tips and tuning

- Softening (`eps2`): increase if Newton fails near point masses; typical start values range 1e‑6 → 1e‑3 depending on geometric units.
- Newton tolerance `tol`: 1e‑10–1e‑12 gives high precision; relax if solver unstable (1e‑8). Monitor ||uOmega(r)|| and step norm.
- Manifold step size `ds`: 1e‑3 → 5e‑3 is usually stable; consider adaptive stepping (smaller ds where curvature large).
- `rmax` and `max_steps`: bound the tracing domain to prevent runaway traces into far field; choose based on your system scale.
- Jacobian conditioning: compute cond(J) or eigenvalue gaps — near‑singular J indicates potential failure or nearby bifurcation.

### 11.5 Diagnostics and tests

- Plot streamlines of `u` or `uOmega` and overlay stagnation points and manifold polylines — the manifolds should sit on separatrices between streamline basins.
- Validate against scalar skeletons: for cases where `n_eff` (or Φ) is defined, run `skeleton_finder.py` and compare ridge/valley lines with manifolds from `VectorFlow`.
- Track conservation: if flows are derived from a potential, verify curl ≈ 0 away from rotating frame contributions; large curl signals non‑conservative behaviour.

### 11.6 Common failure modes & remedies

- Newton fails (LinAlgError): increase `eps2`, perturb seed, fall back to quasi‑Newton (Broyden) or use `continue_stagnations` with neighbouring successful roots as seeds.
- Manifold tracing stalls (very small |v|): reduce `ds`, or stop and treat as terminus (manifold reached another equilibrium or an asymptotic region).
- Spirals / complex eigenvalues: manifold tracing along real eigenvectors is not applicable — treat as local spirals and plot phase portraits instead.

### 11.7 Supplementary implementation notes (potential additions)
- Example `VectorFlow` usage snippet (classification + manifolds).
- Guidance on parameter selection (`eps2`, `tol`, `ds`, `rmax`).

- Why it matters: a substrate implies modified vacuum structure which can alter semiclassical predictions (Hawking radiation, vacuum polarization).
- Signature: modified particle emission spectra near compact objects; decoherence signatures.
- Test: model simple quantum fields on a dispersive medium background to estimate deviations from standard semiclassical predictions.

Short prioritized project concepts
- GW dispersion demo: implement a toy 1D wave propagation code with tunable dispersion to generate templates and bounds (useful and fast).
- Effective metric mapping: derive conditions under which index+flow map to an effective metric and parameterize deviations (PPN‑style).
- Horizon echo simulation: ray tracing on a model substrate that stiffens near a core to look for echoes in time series.

Observational constraints and cautions
- Many constraints (GW speed, Lorentz tests, solar‑system PPN) are already tight; pushing‑medium parameter space must be chosen to respect these. Some signatures may be degenerate with astrophysical noise.
- Care is required to avoid ad‑hoc tuning: focus on physically motivated constitutive relations and explore falsifiable predictions.

### Local perturbations with remote amplification

The pushing‑medium formulae contain several explicit mechanisms that allow small, local perturbations to produce large remote effects. Below are the primary amplification channels and short computational/experimental checks you can run.

1) Nonlocal kernel (1/|r−r'|)
- Source: continuous index formula
    $$n(\mathbf{r}) = 1 + \frac{2G}{c^2} \int \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} \, d^3r'$$
- Mechanism: a point perturbation Δρ at r0 changes n at r by Δn(r) ∝ Δm/|r−r0|. Although decaying, this is nonzero arbitrarily far away and can be exploited by focusing geometries or resonant paths.
- Quick check: compute Δn(r) analytically for a point Δm and plot vs |r−r0|; integrate along a ray bundle to estimate accumulated phase shift.

2) Path accumulation (Fermat functional)
- Source: Fermat functional and ray advection
    $$T=\int n\,ds - \frac{1}{c}\int (n^2-1)(\mathbf{u}_g\cdot\hat{\mathbf{k}})\,ds$$
- Mechanism: small Δn along a long or critical path integrates to a large ΔT (phase/time delay). Interferometers and long baseline rays are especially sensitive.
- Quick check: add a narrow Δn bump into a lensing simulation and measure ΔT for long‑baseline vs short‑baseline rays.

3) Focusing and caustics
- Source: spatial dependence of n in ray equations
- Mechanism: lenses concentrate energy at caustics; tiny lens changes shift caustic location producing huge intensity changes at the focal plane.
- Quick check: ray trace through an asymmetric lens and compute focal intensity sensitivity to small core perturbations.

4) Flow-induced Doppler and directional effects
- Source: advection term in ray velocity and wave Doppler shifts from u_g
- Mechanism: small u_g along an extended region causes cumulative Doppler shifts or preferred transmission for one direction, potentially moving waves into resonance at remote sites.
- Quick check: simulate 1D wave packet crossing a localized u_g and measure transmitted amplitude and frequency shift vs u_g.

5) Nonlinear thresholding and phase change
- Source: substrate constitutive nonlinearity n(ρ_s,P_s)
- Mechanism: local seed perturbations may nucleate a phase that expands (like a combustion front), converting small local changes into macroscopic regions of altered n.
- Quick check: evolve a bistable 1D substrate PDE with a small localized perturbation and monitor front propagation.

6) Parametric / resonant amplification via time modulation
- Source: time‑dependent n(r,t)
- Mechanism: local periodic pumping can parametrically amplify certain spatial modes, producing large distant responses if resonance conditions are met.
- Quick check: 1D Floquet simulation with local time modulation and measure transmitted mode amplitudes.

Practical notes
- Even though these channels permit amplification, physical constraints (1/|r| decay, causality, observational bounds) limit dramatic long‑range amplification unless combined with focusing, resonance, or nonlinear growth.
- These mechanisms are useful for designing sensitive tests: interferometric setups, long‑baseline timing, and lensing caustics are promising probes.

### Information leakage & substrate channels

The pushing‑medium picture explicitly exposes substrate channels that can carry, degrade, or reroute information compared with the pure‑geometry picture of GR. Below are the principal leakage channels, their physical origin, observational signatures, and quick checks.

1) Nonlocal encoding via the Poisson kernel
- Origin: $n(\mathbf{r})$ depends on the integral of mass/substrate over space, so local events imprint a global field.
- Signature: small local mass/substrate changes produce distant Δn and therefore phase/time shifts detectable by long‑baseline interferometry.
- Check: analytic Δn(r) for a localized Δm and integrated ray delay.

2) Substrate internal modes (phonons, vorticity)
- Origin: substrate supports microscopic excitations; gravitational disturbances can excite them, transferring information out of the bulk gravitational channel.
- Signature: excess damping, thermal-like emission, or delayed substrate radiative tails.
- Check: couple a wave equation to a damped harmonic oscillator bath and measure energy transfer.

3) Dissipative loss and entropy production
- Origin: viscous or resistive substrate dynamics convert coherent waves into heat/noise.
- Signature: decoherence, mismatch between emitted gravitational energy and observed coherent signal.
- Check: 1D viscous wave simulation measuring coherent vs dissipated energy.

4) Mode conversion and polarization leakage
- Origin: anisotropic/inhomogeneous n and u_g allow mixing between polarization channels and scalar substrate modes.
- Signature: cross‑polarization signals, reduced signal fidelity in detectors tuned to GR polarizations.
- Check: propagate polarized wave through layered anisotropic index and measure mixing fractions.

5) Flow transport and advective routing
- Origin: u_g advects substrate excitations and wavepackets, moving information along flow lines away from naive geometrical predictions.
- Signature: Doppler‑shifted components, direction‑dependent arrival times.
- Check: simulate wave crossing a Gaussian flow patch and record transmitted spectra vs direction.

6) Porous horizons and tunnelling leakage
- Origin: refractive trapping regions may be frequency‑selective and leaky, allowing partial tunnelling of information across would‑be horizons.
- Signature: echoes, early/late weak signals correlated with merger events.
- Check: ray/wave tunnelling analysis across an index well with frequency‑dependent transmissivity.

7) Disorder trapping and late‑time leakage
- Origin: disorder in n(r) can localize energy and release it slowly via tunnelling, spreading information over long times.
- Signature: long‑tail, frequency‑dependent late emission.
- Check: 1D random‑index FDTD with localized injection and measurement of late‑time leakage.

8) Resonant parametric channels
- Origin: local time‑dependent modulation can pump resonant distant modes, transferring information via narrow frequency channels.
- Signature: stimulated distant emission at resonant frequencies; high sensitivity to modulation parameters.
- Check: Floquet analysis of a local modulated patch and remote response measurement.

Practical constraints
- Any viable model must respect causality and observational bounds (GW speed, PPN limits). Leakage may be subtle and often converts coherent information into thermal/stochastic noise rather than usable signal.

## 11. Gravitational Manipulation, Valves & Diodes

One of the intuitions that the pushing‑medium picture makes natural is that, if gravity is mediated by a material substrate with spatially varying refractive index and flow, it may be possible in principle to design structures that steer, block, or permit one‑way propagation of gravitational effects in an analogous way to optical devices (lenses, isolators, and diodes). Below we summarize concepts, simple toy models, feasible experiments, and fundamental caveats.

### 11.1 Terminology and concepts
- Gravitational manipulation: active or passive shaping of the substrate state (index $n$ and flow $\mathbf{u}_g$) to control trajectories of rays/particles and wave propagation.
- Gravitational valve / diode: a configuration that allows transmission of gravitational influence (rays or waves) in one direction but strongly suppresses it in the opposite direction (non‑reciprocal behaviour).

### 11.2 Mechanisms available in the pushing‑medium picture
- Index gradients and asymmetric geometry: spatially non‑symmetric index profiles can produce strongly direction‑dependent ray deflections (geometric valve).
- Flow advection (non‑reciprocity): a background flow $\mathbf{u}_g(\mathbf{r})$ breaks time‑reversal symmetry for wave/ray propagation and can produce Doppler‑shifted, non‑reciprocal transmission (flow diode).
- Active modulation / time‑dependence: time‑periodic modulation of $n$ or $\mathbf{u}_g$ (parametric pumping) can produce one‑way bandgaps and isolation similar to Floquet isolators in photonics.
- Nonlinear substrate response: thresholded or hysteretic substrate behaviour (phase change, stiffening) can act like a valve that opens for strong incident flux but closes for weak or reverse flux.

### 11.3 Simple toy models (equations and intuition)
- Asymmetric lens (passive): a 2D index profile
    $$n(x,y)=1+\varepsilon\,\frac{1+\alpha\,\mathrm{tanh}(x/L)}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+\epsilon^2}}$$
    For large positive $x$ the effective lensing strength differs from the negative side, producing direction‑dependent deflection angles for rays traversing the region.
- Flow diode (advection): add a localized flow patch
    $$\mathbf{u}_g(x,y)=U_0\,e^{-r^2/\sigma^2}\,\hat{x}$$
    Waves/rays propagating with the flow are Doppler‑boosted and can pass; those against the flow encounter an effective barrier (blue/red shifted dispersion relations).
- Active Floquet valve: time modulation
    $$n(\mathbf{r},t)=n_0(\mathbf{r})+\delta n(\mathbf{r})\cos(\Omega t)$$
    With suitable spatial asymmetry this can create directional bandgaps for wave propagation (one‑way windows in frequency/wavevector space).

### 11.4 Simulation & experiment suggestions (small projects)
- Ray‑tracing demo: implement a 2D ray tracer through the asymmetric lens above and show forward vs reverse transmission maps (transmission coefficient vs impact parameter).
- Wave packet simulation: 1D/2D finite‑difference propagation of small amplitude waves in presence of a Gaussian flow patch and measure transmission asymmetry vs flow speed $U_0$ and frequency.
- Laboratory analogue: build a metamaterial plate or water‑tank experiment where an index analogue (sound speed or refractive index) is varied spatially and temporally to show non‑reciprocal wave transmission.

### 11.5 Practical limitations and fundamental constraints
- Causality and energy: any valve/diode must respect causality — the substrate characteristic speeds (signal speed) must not allow superluminal signalling. Energy conservation requires attention to active modulation sources.
- Observational constraints: large, static one‑way gravitational devices would likely have been noticed astrophysically; realistic devices are small and subtle and must avoid violating solar‑system bounds.
- Reciprocity in linear, time‑invariant conservative systems: passive, linear, lossless media are reciprocal. Non‑reciprocity requires either flow (breaking T‑symmetry), nonlinearity, loss/gain, or time‑dependence.

### 11.6 Potential applications (speculative)
- Gravitational shielding analogue (local redirection of trajectories for debris mitigation) — likely tiny effects only.
- Directional gravitational couplers for laboratory tabletop experiments — allow controlled injection or extraction of substrate waves.
- Black‑hole mimics with asymmetric echoes — testbeds for echo searches.

### 11.7 Safety, ethics, and claims
- Any claim about controllable, engineered gravitational forces should be treated cautiously. Even in the pushing‑medium picture the magnitudes are likely tiny for plausible substrate parameter choices.
- Emphasize lab analogues and scaled demonstrations (acoustic, optical, or fluid) rather than claims of practical propulsion or macroscopic gravity control.

## 12. Further Unexplored Phenomena

The pushing‑medium framework suggests several additional phenomena that are natural to explore but not typically discussed in GR. Each offers different observational or experimental handles.

1) Topological defects (vortices, domain walls)
- Why: defects create long‑range phase structures in $n$ and $\mathbf{u}_g$, producing Aharonov–Bohm–like effects for rays and waves.
- Quick test: introduce a vortex u_g in a 2D wave simulation and look for quantized phase jumps or wavefront splitting.

2) Substrate anisotropic inertia / effective mass changes
- Why: local substrate state may modify inertial response, producing apparent mass variations or modified orbital frequencies.
- Quick test: integrate two‑body orbits where one body passes through a high‑n patch and measure period shifts.

3) Modified gravitational memory (viscoelastic substrate)
- Why: substrate relaxation can store residual strain, changing permanent displacement (memory) signatures from transient waves.
- Quick test: propagate a TT pulse in a viscoelastic 1D medium and measure residual particle displacements.

4) Tidal heating and viscous dissipation
- Why: substrate viscosity converts orbital energy to heat, altering inspiral rates and emitted signals.
- Quick test: add a simple viscous drag term to orbit integrators and compare inspiral time vs vacuum GR.

5) Mode conversion and extra polarizations
- Why: anisotropic, layered or nonlinear media mix polarizations, producing detectable non‑GR polarization content.
- Quick test: wave propagation through anisotropic layered n(r) and measure polarization mixing.

6) Anderson localization of substrate waves
- Why: disorder in n(r) can localize waves, suppressing long‑range GW transport.
- Quick test: 1D random‑index FDTD to map localization length vs disorder strength.

7) Stimulated emission and resonance (Cherenkov‑like effects)
- Why: moving masses can excite substrate modes, leading to resonant energy transfer or stimulated emission.
- Quick test: sweep source speed in 1D medium and look for thresholds where transmitted energy grows rapidly.

8) Superradiant scattering from rotating flow regions
- Why: rotating u_g regions can amplify incident waves, analogous to black‑hole superradiance.
- Quick test: scatter wave packets off a rotating flow patch and measure amplification vs rotation rate.

9) Quantum decoherence via substrate coupling
- Why: substrate fluctuations serve as a decohering environment for quantum fields or interferometers.
- Quick test: model stochastic substrate noise and compute expected decoherence rates for atom interferometry near masses.

10) Chaotic collective dynamics from substrate back‑reaction
- Why: coupled N‑body + substrate feedback can introduce new resonances and chaos beyond Newtonian expectations.
- Quick test: compute Lyapunov exponents for small N systems with and without substrate coupling.

11) Porous / leaky horizon analogues
- Why: substrate horizons may be frequency‑dependent or leaky, producing echo structures and partial transparency.
- Quick test: ray/wave propagation near an index well with absorption/dispersion to look for echoes.

12) Catalytic large emissions from metastable substrate modes
- Why: metastable substrate modes could be triggered by small seeds to emit large energy bursts.
- Quick test: bistable PDE with localized trigger and measurement of emitted wave energy after nucleation.

These topics can be expanded with quantitative scaling relations in future revisions.
