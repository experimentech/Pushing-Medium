This repository details an alternate gravitational model based on the concept that gravity is a pushing force.

It was developed by LLM with human oversight.

As a believable description of the universe, that's up to you. I'm not telling you what to believe. As a computational tool it works well.

This is an early draft of everything and pretty much just dumped into the wild so the curious can have a look.

Most document formatting is less than ideal. Many tex files won't render yet. Check the image_formatted, markdown, pdf, or txt directories. If you are feeling adventurous / have better tools for compiling latex, do that.

In the programs directory there are some demos in "demos", obviously. There's also a Python library with an implementation of the formulae to play with if you are so inclined. "misc" is a few scripts of limited use. "junk" is junk.

This is all released in the public domain for free use.
